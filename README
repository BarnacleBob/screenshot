The goal of this program is to store screenshots on s3 (and others) as simple as possible
while still presenting a HTML based browser for all the screenshots.

The script uses the boto library to upload content to S3:

   boto - Python interface to Amazon Web Services - http://code.google.com/p/boto/

There is also support for storing metadata and image data in CouchDB. This uses httplib
and stores them in a document with a 'image' attachment.

If configured you can also use a tinyurl service, although support for that is very limited
at the moment. It only supports a HTTP POST to a custom script.


--- sample ~/.screenshot/screenshot.ini config file ---
[screenshot]
use_clipboard = yes
egress_fqdn = screenshot.example.net

[s3]
enabled = yes
key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
secret = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
bucket = XXXXXXXXXX
